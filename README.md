# Pay-per-View Content Distribution

## Project Description

This project is designed to create a decentralized pay-per-view (PPV) system using blockchain technology. Content creators can upload their videos or content to the platform, and users can pay to access the content directly through Ethereum smart contracts. The contract ensures that the creators receive the payment instantly upon user purchase, and the process remains transparent, secure, and decentralized.

## Project Vision

The vision of this project is to build a decentralized content distribution platform where content creators can monetize their work without relying on intermediaries. By leveraging blockchain technology, we aim to offer a more efficient, transparent, and fair platform for both creators and viewers. The system should also reduce piracy by making content access verifiable on the blockchain.

## Key Features

- **Pay-per-View Model**: Content is priced per view, and users can pay for individual content pieces.
- **Direct Payment to Creators**: Payments are made directly to content creators in Ethereum.
- **Transparent Access**: The blockchain ensures that content access is verifiable and transparent.
- **Content Management**: Creators can add new content along with a price tag.
- **Security and Decentralization**: Ethereum's blockchain ensures the system is secure, decentralized, and free from third-party control.

## Future Scope

- **Multiple Content Types**: Support for various types of content, such as video, audio, and images.
- **Subscription Model**: Implementing subscription-based models where users can access multiple contents for a fixed price.
- **Content Rating**: Allow users to rate content, helping others to choose content they might enjoy.
- **Creator Analytics**: Provide content creators with detailed analytics about their earnings and views.
- **Cross-Platform Access**: Allow access to the content across different platforms (mobile, web, etc.).
- **Integration with other blockchains**: Expanding the platform to other blockchains for wider accessibility.
